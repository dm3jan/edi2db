## edi2db

This script reads edi files as used in amateur radio vhf/uhf/shf
contests and puts them in a sqlite database for further evaluation. 

Documentation for the file format can be found
[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20240526210920/https://www.ok2kkw.com/ediformat.htm). 

## Usage

Put your .edi files in the subfolder `logfiles` and run the script. Your
database will be in the `logfiles.db`. You can use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for example for viewing.
